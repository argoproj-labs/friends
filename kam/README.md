## KAM - GitOps Application Manager

Maintainer: [@sbose78](https://github.com/sbose78)

Repository: [GitOps Application Manager](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam)

The [GitOps Application Manager](https://github.com/redhat-developer/kam) provides a command line interface to bootstrap an opinionated GitOps repository layout. By providing the URL to your Git-hosted applications, it generates Argo CD-based CD and application manifests. Simply deploy (apply) them to your cluster, and you will see the applications in the Argo CD web UI.
